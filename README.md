# Lumped Parameter Model of a Ball Bearing
# Toy Lumped-Parameter Bearing Model 

In this article, a 1D-toy bearing model is detailed based on the article https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271443. This repository is a simplified version which can be a basis for anyone's more advanced modelling. It can be used, adjusted to anyone's desire and research purpose. In the latter case, a reference to the work https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271443 would be highly appreciated.
