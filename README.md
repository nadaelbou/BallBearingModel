# Lumped-Parameter Ball Bearing Model 

In this repository, a 1D bearing model is given based on the article https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271443. The model has been carefully studied for a specific set-up and its hyperparameters can be adjusted to the specific geometry of any bearing.

## Idea behind the Model

A radial lumped-parameter model is developed on MATLAB/Simulink for a single ball in contact with the bearing races under a load distribution as a function of its angular position on the races. This simplified radial model identifies fault signatures in frequency domain for inner and outer ring defects. 

As given, the model is discretized from the rotor to the shaft and owns 4 degrees of freedom. The
